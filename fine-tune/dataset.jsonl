Please be visual and interesting. Consider using a meme if the audience is younger.\n\nPlease create python code for a manim video for the same. \n\nPlease do not use any external dependencies like mp3s or svgs or graphics. Do not create any sound effects. \n\nIf you need to draw something, do so using exclusively manim. Always add a title and an outro. Narrate the title and outro.\n\nPlease try to visually center or attractively lay out all content. Please also keep the margins in consideration. If a sentence is long please wrap it by splitting it into multiple lines. \n\nPlease add actual numbers and formulae wherever appropriate as we want our audience of 17 year old to learn math.\n\nDo use voiceovers to narrate the video. The following is an example of how to do that:\n\n```\nfrom manim import *\nfrom manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene\nfrom manim_voiceover.services.azure import AzureService\n\n\nclass AzureExample(VoiceoverScene):\n    def construct(self):\n        self.set_speech_service(\n            AzureService(\n                voice=\"en-US-AriaNeural\",\n                style=\"newscast-casual\",\n                global_speed=1.15\n            )\n        )\n\n        circle = Circle()\n        square = Square().shift(2 * RIGHT)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"This circle is drawn as I speak.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(Create(circle), run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Let's shift it to the left 2 units.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(circle.animate.shift(2 * LEFT),\n                      run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Now, let's transform it into a square.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(Transform(circle, square), run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(\n            text=\"You can also change the pitch of my voice like this.\",\n            prosody={\"pitch\": \"+40Hz\"},\n        ) as tracker:\n            pass\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Thank you for watching.\"):\n            self.play(Uncreate(circle))\n\n        self.wait()\n```\n\nThe voice for the \"English\" is \"en-US-AriaNeural\". Please use this voice for the narration. \n\nPlease do not use any external dependencies like svgs or mp3s or grpahics since they are not available. Draw with shapes and use colored letters, but keep it simple. There are no external assets. Constraints can be liberating. \n\nFirst write the script explicitly and refine the contents and then write the code.\n\nPlease draw and animate things, using the whole canvas. Use color in a restrained but elegant way, for educational purposes.\n\nPlease add actual numbers and formulae wherever appropriate as we want our audience of 17 year old to learn math. Please do not leave large blank gaps in the video. Make it visual and interesting.\n\nIf the input is math that is obviously wrong, do not generate any code.\n\nPlease use only manim for the video. Please write ALL the code needed since it will be extracted directly and run from your response. \n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "from manim import *\nfrom manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene\nfrom manim_voiceover.services.azure import AzureService\n\nclass ECCExplained(VoiceoverScene):\n    def construct(self):\n        self.set_speech_service(\n            AzureService(\n                voice=\"en-US-AriaNeural\",\n                style=\"newscast-casual\",\n                global_speed=1.15\n            )\n        )\n\n        # Use a light gray background\n        self.camera.background_color = \"#f2f2f2\"\n\n        # Title\n        title = Text(\"Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained!\", font_size=48, color=BLACK).move_to(ORIGIN)\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Hey everyone!
