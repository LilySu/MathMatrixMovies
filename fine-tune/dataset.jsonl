Here is a quote from Science News - March 15, 1975: \"By 1976, the price of some calculators is expected to drop to as little as $10. If it does, the possibility of supplying public schools with them, and consequently incorporating them into elementary- and high-school math programs, may become very real.\" To this I, Aditya Advani, might add that LLMs and codegen allow kids to explore ideas in a combinatorial space. Hence I'd like to compare the introduction of LLMs as a gamechanger like introduction of calculators, and show how helping kids explore an idea space is so powerful compared to previous modes of iteration. Make a powerful analogy video for me to post in reply to Daniel's tweet about the calculators and his thoughts. TYSM!'\n\nPlease be visual and interesting in your explanation. Consider using a meme if the audience is younger.\n\nPlease create python code for a manim video for the same. \n\nDo not create any sound effects. The only images you have access to are svgs you can download with the download_svg_from_query fn. Scale svgs appropriately for use please.\n\nAlways add a title and an outro. Always narrate the title and outro.\n\nPlease try to visually center or attractively lay out all content. Please also keep the margins in consideration. If a sentence is long please wrap it by splitting it into multiple lines. \n\nPlease add actual numbers and formulae wherever appropriate as we want our 16 year olds to learn math & reason visually and conceptually as well.\n\nDo use voiceovers to narrate the video. The following is an example of how to do that, and also how to import the download_svg_from_query function:\n\n```\nfrom manim import *\nfrom manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene\nfrom manim_voiceover.services.azure import AzureService\nfrom create_movie import download_svg_from_query\n\nclass AzureExample(VoiceoverScene):\n    def construct(self):\n        self.set_speech_service(\n            AzureService(\n                voice=\"en-US-AriaNeural\",\n                style=\"newscast-casual\",\n                global_speed=1.15\n            )\n        )\n\n        # Download SVGs\n        brain_svg = download_svg_from_query(\"brain\")\n        cnn_svg = download_svg_from_query(\"computer\")\n        rnn_svg = download_svg_from_query(\"flow chart\")\n        transformer_svg = download_svg_from_query(\"robot\")\n        robot_svg = download_svg_from_query(\"robot\")\n\n        # Draw shapes\n        circle = Circle()\n        square = Square().shift(2 * RIGHT)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"This circle is drawn as I speak.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(Create(circle), run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Let's shift it to the left 2 units.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(circle.animate.shift(2 * LEFT),\n                      run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Now, let's transform it into a square.\") as tracker:\n            self.play(Transform(circle, square), run_time=tracker.duration)\n\n        with self.voiceover(\n            text=\"You can also change the pitch of my voice like this.\",\n            prosody={\"pitch\": \"+40Hz\"},\n        ) as tracker:\n            pass\n\n        with self.voiceover(text=\"Thank you for watching.\"):\n            self.play(Uncreate(circle))\n\n        self.wait()\n```\n\nThe voice for the \"English\" is \"en-US-AriaNeural\".

Use color.\n\nPlease add actual numbers and formulae wherever appropriate as we want our audience of 16 year olds to learn math. Please do not leave large blank gaps in the video. Make it visual and interesting. PLEASE ENSURE ELEMENTS FADE OUT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. DO NOT LEAVE ARTIFACTS ACROSS SCENES AS THEY OVERLAP AND ARE JARRING. WRAP TEXT IF IT IS LONG. FORMAT TABLES CORRECTLY. ENSURE LABELS, FORMULAE, TEXT AND OBJECTS DO NOT OVERLAP OR OCCLUDE EACH OTHER. Be elegant video designer. Scale charts and numbers to fit the screen. And don't let labels run into each other or overlap, or take up poor positions. For example, do not label a triangle side length at the corners, but the middle. Do not write equations that spill across the Y axis bar or X axis bar, etc.\n\nIf the input is math that is obviously wrong, do not generate any code.\n\nYou can search for svgs for objects like 'tree' and 'satellite' and then download them and get the download path using the download_svg_from_query('satellite') fn. DO NOT MAKE UP PATHS, USE THE download_svg_from_query(query) fn\n\nYou can also search_google for concepts and then ingest the results into this context via fetch_html to create your video. Include \"manim\" in the search query if you need syntactical help. Do any research BEFORE writing code.\n\nPlease use only manim for the video. Please write ALL the code needed in one block in your final response since it will be extracted directly and run from your response. \n\nMake it visual and interesting please. The goal is to demonstrate concepts through cool visuals and animations, not present a powerpoint. Flex the power of Manim to create beautiful visuals and animations. Feel free to look up syntax and examples from the internet. \n\nConsider all the requirements carefully, but have fun and be creative. Use tools to download images or do research, or both, then in your final answer write all the code. ALL THE CODE IN THE FINAL BLOCK PLEASE.
