00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,708
Let's learn about multiplication!

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:07,065
Imagine you have 3 baskets.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,686
And each basket has 4 apples.

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:14,262
We can count all the apples one by one.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,540
But there's a faster way: multiplication!

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:22,550
We have 3 baskets, and each basket has 4 apples.

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:26,609
So, we can write this as 3 times 4.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,020
Which equals 12! We have 12 apples in total.

9
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:41,473
That's multiplication! It's a quick way to

10
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,062
add the same number many times.
