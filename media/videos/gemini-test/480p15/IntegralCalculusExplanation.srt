00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,948
Let's dive into integral calculus!

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,481
Imagine we have a curve, like this.

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:12,574
Integral calculus helps us find the area under this curve.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,012
We can approximate this area by using rectangles.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,084
The thinner the rectangles, the more accurate our approximation.

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,307
We represent this process of finding the

7
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,774
exact area with the integral symbol.

8
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:32,350
We integrate a function, in this case, x squared.

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,273
And we specify the limits of integration, from 1 to 4.

10
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:40,414
This integral gives us the precise area

11
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:42,926
under the curve between these limits.

12
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:47,878
That's a glimpse into the power of integral calculus!
