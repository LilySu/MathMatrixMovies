00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,383
Imagine a game of chess. After just the first

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:07,796
few moves, things can get really complex, really quickly!

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:12,806
Let's explore the sheer number of possible moves after only 10 moves.

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:15,981
This graph shows approximately how many different

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,670
chess games are possible after each move.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,956
After just one move per player, there are already 20 possible games!

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,878
That number jumps to 400 after two moves each.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,790
After five moves, it's already hard

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,260
to imagine: almost 200,000 possible games!

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,492
But after 10 moves, things explode.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,466
Over 3 billion different possible chess

12
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,900
games exist after just 10 moves!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
That's why chess is so amazing. It's a game of

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,292
near infinite possibilities, even in just a few moves.
