00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,413
Let's understand Gradient Descent, an algorithm for

2
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:05,756
finding the minimum of a function.

3
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:17,049
Imagine you're on a hill, and you want to find the lowest point.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,884
You can do this by taking steps downhill,

5
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:23,668
in the direction of the steepest descent.

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,343
The gradient of a function tells us the direction of

7
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:31,553
the steepest ascent. So, we move in the opposite direction.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,876
Step 1. We calculate the gradient and take a step downhill.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,372
Step 2. We calculate the gradient and take a step downhill.

10
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:49,857
Step 3. We calculate the gradient and take a step downhill.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,372
Step 4. We calculate the gradient and take a step downhill.

12
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:02,977
Step 5. We calculate the gradient and take a step downhill.

13
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,114
We continue this process, taking smaller and

14
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:09,985
smaller steps as we approach the minimum.

15
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,286
Eventually, we converge to the lowest point of the function.
