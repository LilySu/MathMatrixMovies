1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,658
Imagine you're standing on this curve, and

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:04,892
you want to find the lowest point.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,818
You can't see the whole curve, so you need a way

4
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:12,284
to find the minimum just by feeling the slope around you.

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,739
That's where Gradient Descent comes in. It's like

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,033
taking small steps downhill, following the steepest descent.

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,394
We calculate the slope at our current location and

8
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:26,218
take a step downhill. The size of the step

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,849
is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate.

10
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,194
We calculate the slope at our current location and

11
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:36,018
take a step downhill. The size of the step

12
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:39,649
is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate.

13
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,994
We calculate the slope at our current location and

14
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,818
take a step downhill. The size of the step

15
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:49,449
is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate.

16
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,794
We calculate the slope at our current location and

17
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:55,618
take a step downhill. The size of the step

18
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:59,249
is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate.

19
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,594
We calculate the slope at our current location and

20
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,418
take a step downhill. The size of the step

21
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:09,049
is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate.

22
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:12,563
By repeatedly taking these steps, we get closer and

23
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:15,609
closer to the minimum point of the function.

24
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,023
And that's Gradient Descent in a nutshell! A

25
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:23,030
simple yet powerful algorithm for finding minimums.
