1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,868
This is a circle with radius 1, so the length of

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:07,073
the circumference is tau. The method we're using here to approximate

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:11,216
tau is to inscribe and circumscribe two polygons around the circle,

4
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:15,422
and the lengths of the polygons' perimeters will approach the length

5
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:19,194
of the circumference as we increase the number of sides. This

6
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:23,276
method is known as the method of exhaustion or Archimedes' method.

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:29,335
Let's first draw an inscribed hexagon. The circumradius is 1, so

8
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:33,161
the side length is also 1. We use the notation I

9
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:37,625
6 to represent the side length of the inscribed hexagon.

10
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:42,654
Let's generalize this length and call it I N, where N is the number

11
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:47,514
of sides. Let's draw a line from the center of the circle to one

12
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:51,918
of the endpoints. It is also a radius, so its length is 1.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
This length is half of the polygon's side,

14
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,132
so its length is I N over 2.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,059
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find

16
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,596
the length of the polygon's apothem.

17
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,262
This length together with the apothem forms a radius, so

18
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:09,430
its length is 1 minus the length of the apothem.

19
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:14,847
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate this length, and by simplifying

20
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:18,316
it, we find this length to be the square root of 2

21
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,438
minus the square root of 4 minus I N squared.

22
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,868
This line is also a side of an inscribed 2 N

23
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,601
gon, so it can be written as I 2 N.

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,479
This is a circumscribed hexagon, its apothem is

25
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,310
also a radius, so its length is 1.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,330
Using the ratio of a 30 60 90 triangle's sides, we can

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,361
find the side length of this hexagon to be 2 times the

28
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:49,093
square root of 3 all over 3. We use the notation C

29
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:53,572
6 to represent the side length of the circumscribed hexagon.

30
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:59,629
Let's generalize this hexagon to be a circumscribed N gon and draw a circumscribed

31
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,622
2 N gon, where its side length is C 2 N by definition.

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:08,846
This line is a side of the inscribed N gon, so its length is I N.

33
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:13,007
This line is a side of the circumscribed 2 N gon, so

34
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,817
if we halve it we get C 2 N over 2.

35
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:19,540
This line is a side of the circumscribed N gon, so

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,030
if we halve it we get C N over 2.

37
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:26,106
This triangle and this triangle are both isosceles and share

38
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:29,694
the same angle at their apexes, so they are similar,

39
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:33,558
and their relation can be expressed as two equal ratios.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,924
After simplifying the equation, we get the formula for finding C 2 N.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,392
Because the inscribed polygon's perimeter is less than the

42
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:47,486
circumference is less than the circumscribed polygon's perimeter, we

43
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,196
can express this relation by this inequality.

44
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,837
Let's try using this method to approximate tau to the second

45
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:59,741
digit after decimal. The perimeters of the polygons match up to

46
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:03,789
two decimal places when we reach N equals 96. We can

47
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,382
thus conclude that tau must be approximately equal to 6.28.
